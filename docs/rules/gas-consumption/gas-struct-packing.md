![Default Severity Badge warn](https://img.shields.io/badge/Default%20Severity-warn-yellow)

## Description
Suggest to re-arrange struct packing order when it is inefficient

## Options
This rule accepts a string option of rule severity. Must be one of "error", "warn", "off". Defaults to warn.

### Example Config
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "gas-struct-packing": "warn"
  }
}
```

### Notes
- This rule assumes all UserDefinedTypeName take a new slot. (beware of Enums inside Structs) 
- Simple cases like a struct with three addresses might be reported as false positive. (needs to be fixed)
