## Description
Suggest Strict Inequalities over non Strict ones

## Options
This rule accepts a string option for rule severity. Must be one of "error", "warn", "off". Defaults to warn.

### Example Config
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "gas-strict-inequalities": "warn"
  }
}
```

### Notes
- Strict inequality does not always saves gas. It is dependent on the context of the surrounding opcodes
