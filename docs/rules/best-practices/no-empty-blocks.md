> The {"extends": "solhint:recommended"} property in a configuration file enables this rule.


## Description
Code block has zero statements inside. Exceptions apply.

## Options
This rule accepts a string option of rule severity. Must be one of "error", "warn", "off". Defaults to warn.

### Example Config
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "no-empty-blocks": "warn"
  }
}
```

### Notes
- The rule ignores an empty constructor by default as long as base contracts are being inherited. See "Empty Constructor" example.

```

### üëé Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule

```
